# Plant Health

A project to track data about my house plants.

## Phase 1 -- Soil Moisture
Start with setting up an Arduino [UNO WIFI REV2](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-wifi-rev2?queryID=undefined) to read from an analog moisture sensor and output the values to the arduino. I went with an Arduino over a Raspberry Pi for this step since the Pi will not natively support analog signals.
